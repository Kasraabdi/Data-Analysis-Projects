# ðŸ“Š Sales Data Analysis & Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for cleaning and analyzing a messy, real-world sales dataset.

> The primary goal is to take raw, imperfect data and transform it into a clean, usable format for analysis, simulating a common task for a data analyst.

## âœ¨ Key Features

-   **Dirty Data Generation:** The `create_messy_data.py` script generates an Excel file (`messy_sales.xlsx`) containing common data issues like missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
-   **Data Cleaning:** The `main.py` script reads the raw data, identifies all issues, and applies cleaning techniques to fix them.
-   **Feature Engineering:** After cleaning, a new feature (`TotalPrice`) is calculated and added to the dataset to enable further analysis.
